#a list is a datatype that contains an ordered list of objects

#the easiest way to create a list is to use the [] notation

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(a)

#the above list alos can be created as follows:

a = list()
a.append(1)
a.append(2)
a.append(3)
a.append(4)
a.append(5)
print(a)

#an empty list can be created as follows:

emptyList = []
emptyList = list()
